##Blogging using jekyll on Github pages

I am web enthusiast to try out new web things so after learning github, I tried to make site using Jekyll(It is a static site generator built using Ruby language).It was a awesome experiance to explore Github pages technology with Markdown. 

I was new for Markdown for a while but It becomes my regular language to write down documents,html pages,to-do notes etc.Find about mark down [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
Download Markdownpad from [here](http://markdownpad.com) to write in Markdown.

It is my first post so same as "Hello world" Program.Blog is uncompleted so dont try to explore it now.

See you soon with new posts and news.

Happy Republic day !!! India
